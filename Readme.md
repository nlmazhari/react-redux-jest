WorkGenius Frontend excercise v4
================================


Setup
-----

- npm install
- npm run dev
- open index.html in a browser (no need to setup a webserver)



Tasks
-----

1. The website contains a small React/Redux application that initially shows a text input and a submit button but the React app does not render. Find out why and fix the bug(s).

2. Implement a simple .gif search App based on the Giphy API.
- after entering a search term into the text input and clicking on the search button the app should query the Giphy API and display related .gifs below the text input.
- The file example_request.txt contains an example of how to access the API and an API key you can use.


Expectations
------------

- delivery about 60mins after start
- you are free to choose whatever approach you like, but there should be obvious reasons
-- you have to use the React/Readux ecosystem, though
- if you feel your choices are not obvious, create a small readme with explanations
